<p>To Dama Ppalgan -</p>

<p>I know you'll intercept this letter because you always intercepted your sister's mail. About a year ago, I thought about mailing her a bomb, knowing that you'd intercept it and it would blow your ugly head off. However, Ppora begged me not to, so I didn't.</p>

<p>I'm currently just beyond the edge of the galaxy, wielding the power of magicks that I've never seen before, hundreds of thousands of years of evaporated mass-energy from a supermassive black hole, and a hot pink laser gun that can shoot down your family's best ships. I designed it just for you: because I know you'll be piloting one of them, and after years of being made to fold your undergarments I know damn well how small your dick is. You see, the luminosity of the gun is inversely proportional to the dick size of the target.</p>

<p>I know you won't hurt your sister, but you will manipulate her by threatening me. So by all means, come at me, bitch. I've attached my extragalactic coordinates, so that you can come here and I can dispose of you once and for all.</p>

<p>With love, Colina Amar</p>

<p>PS - Fuck you.</p>

<p>To Dama Ppora -</p>

<p>I'm writing to let you know that I am alive, and that I'm sorry for leaving so suddenly. You've probably figured it out by now, but Ppalgan and his goons tried to arrest me. I took off in our ship, but they shot me down and I crash-landed on a strange planet near some bbq place.</p>

<p>Here's where things get really confusing and hard to believe. There were a bunch of other people at the bbq place who had similarly just ended up there, but a talking spaceship, the Phantasmagoria, had arranged for us to all come here. (Does this mean the Phantasmagoria was behind Ppalgan's plan? Or maybe the Phantasmagoria kept me from being shot down until I got to the bbq place? I'm suspicious now.) Anyways, we barely got to enjoy the food when the restaurant musician turned out to be an eldritch abomination who summoned an army of monsters to try to capture us. I slapped his face off though. We escaped in the Phantasmagoria though, and it told us that we need to fly to the edge of the galaxy in order to save the universe. I guess none of the rest of us had anything better to do because we took off, even though what the ship was saying didn't really make any sense, and still doesn't make sense, actually. Anyways, that's how me and a bunch of other randoms became the crew of the Phantasmagoria.</p>

<p>I had a funny dream that night. The crew of the Phantasmagoria was in some weird landscape where I could travel by imagining teaching you how to finger-paint, which would cause me to turn into pink finger paint that was carried away on the wind.</p>

<p>Actually, maybe this whole thing is a dream. Maybe I'm dreaming right now. I piloted the Phantasmagoria into a diseased whale the size of a black hole and nuked the parasites that were eating it, then almost died trying to fix the ship up from the damage it sustained when I charged. It was worth it, though, and afterwards that musician came back and I killed him again by kicking him while shooting fire out of my foot. Then he came back, trying to destroy all civilization on Maglubiyet by unleashing the energy of a black hole, and this time my crewmate Lamenta killed him again.</p>

<p>I need to tell you about Lamenta, because she's probably the craziest person I've ever met. Well, I said person, but she's more of an evil squid thing with psychic powers who subsists on a diet of human brains. It's geniunely disgusting shit and I'm counting down the days until she tries to eat me and I blow her brains out in self-defense.</p>

<p>Yeah, I'm out of my fucking mind. There's no way anything in the above is real. Just writing it down makes it seem like a load of bullshit.</p>

<p>Don't worry about me, though, because I actually have some self-awareness now so I can't be completely crazy. When I was on Maglubiyet, I realized that our adventures almost got you killed several times. But doing crazy shit like riding my robot snake into battle are the only times I really feel something.</p>

<p>So when I see you again, we're going to go on an adventure, but I'm going to have mastered the art of abjuration by then, to protect you from what I call living and my crewmate Koschei calls stupidity. For the record, Koschei has a stick up his ass and only thinks about riding his horse all day.</p>

<p>I want you to think about what you want. Do you want to escape from your brother's clutches? Or should we dispose of him and install you as the heir of the Dama Conglomerate? You probably don't have a way of responding to this message, but one day I'll return, much stronger than when I left. I think that day will be soon, because this journey feels like it's approaching its end. After dealing with all the dumb bullshit I've been through, I'll be in the mood to blow lots of shit up for you.</p>
