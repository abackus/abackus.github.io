  <dt>Aidan Backus, Peter Connick, Joshua Lin. <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.04540">An algorithm for computing root multiplicities in Kac-Moody algebras</a></b></dt>
    <dd>[math.RA, math.CO] (10 December, 2019) Root multiplicities encode information about the structure of Kac-Moody algebras, and appear in applications as far-reaching as string theory and the theory of modular functions. We provide an algorithm based on the Peterson recurrence formula to compute multiplicities, and argue that it is more efficient than the naive algorithm. You can also view an <a href="https://github.com/catuse/kacmoody/blob/master/kac_moody_algebra.sage">implementation in Sage</a>, to be optimized and submitted to the Sage Project soon!

  <dt>Aidan Backus. <b><a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.13765">The Breit-Wigner series for non-compactly supported potentials on the line</a></b></dt>
      <dd>[math.AP, quant-ph] (28 May, 2020) We propose a conjecture stating that for resonances, \lambda_j, of a noncompactly supported potential, the series \sum_j \Im \lambda_j/|\lambda_j|^2 diverges. This series appears in the Breit-Wigner approximation for a compactly supported potential, in which case it converges. We provide heuristic motivation for this conjecture and prove it in several cases.</dd>

<dt>Aidan Backus. <b><a href="thesis.pdf">The Breit-Wigner series and distribution of resonances of potentials</a></b></dt>
<dd>[math.AP, quant-ph] (24 April, 2020) My undergraduate thesis. We propose a conjecture stating that for resonances \lambda_j of a non-compactly supported potential, the series \sum_j \Im \lambda_j/|\lambda_j|^2 diverges. Such sums naturally appear in the Breit-Wigner approximation of a compactly supported potential. We review the proofs of the Riesz representation formula for subharmonic functions and Titchmarsh's theorem on the distribution of zeroes of the Fourier transform of a compactly supported distribution, and use them to give a proof of the Breit-Wigner approximation that was outlined by Dyatlov and Zworski. We then prove our conjecture in several cases.</dd>
<dt>Naveen Vaidya, Angelica Bloomquist, et al. <b><a href="http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/math-reu/2018-1.pdf">Mathematical Models for Linking Within-Host and Between-Host Viral Dynamics: The Effect of Antibodies on the Probability of Transmission</a></b></dt>
<dd>[math.DS, math.AP, q-bio] (7 August, 2018) A report on work done at the 2018 San Diego State University REU.
  Lack of HIV vaccines have made therapy essential to the reduction of HIV transmission and control of epidemics.  For the implementation of control strategies, it is critical to understand between-host transmission dynamics involving proper risk of infection, which depends on the within-host HIV dynamics of the source. In this study we develop mathematical models linking within-host and between-host HIV dynamics.  In particular, we incorporate antibody response into within-host viral dynamics models to estimate the probability of transmission from an infected individual to an uninfected indivdual.  Our models predict that this proba-bility is largely dependent on the sourceâ€™s disease status, including viral load and antibody profile.  Using the probability of infection resulting from within-host models, we then develop models to describe the dynamicsof between-host transmission, which is consistent with HIV prevalence data from South Africa.
  With these models, we evaluate how within-host disease status of infected individuals influences the between-host spreadof HIV within communities.</dd>

<h2 id="writings">Miscellaneous writing</h2>
Something of a hobby project that began while studying for exams in Summer 2020, I've been writing a <b><a href="measureHobbyProject.pdf">book on measure theory</a></b>.
It originally took heavy inspiration from Marc Rieffel's <a href="https://math.berkeley.edu/~rieffel/measinteg.html">Lectures on measure and integration</a>, which I originally learned measure theory from, but I would not be sharing them if they had not significantly diverged from their source. In particular, the exposition is entirely my own, though the proofs are not all mine, many due to the lecture notes of Conrad and Rieffel, the books of Lang and Pugh, et cetra.
I sought to include lots of examples and pictures, which the treatments of Rieffel and Lang sorely lack, while still operating at a high level of abstraction: most of the time in measure theory, the structure of <b>R</b><sup>d</sup> is just a distraction, and the same arguments would work in an arbitrary Banach space. By stripping away the unnecessary hypotheses, I think the proofs become much clearer.
Currently the book is in version 0.1. No chapter is done, though Chapters 1-2 and Appendix B are.

Various other things I wrote at some point:
<ul>
  <li><b>My undergraduate notes</b>, in <a href="analysis.pdf">analysis</a> and <a href="logic.pdf">logic</a>.
    <ul><li>Topics in the analysis notes include: the Bochner integral, ergodic theory and the Hopf argument, the Liouville-Arnold theorem, the Toda lattice and its applications to the QR algorithm, Siegel's KAM theorem, information theory, the holomorphic functional calculus, the GNS construction of a C*-algebra, C*-representation theory of locally compact groups, noncommutative geometry, Hormander's L^2 estimates in several complex variables, Bergman kernels and their application to Chow's theorem, Fourier decoupling, the pseudodifferential calculus with applications to the FBI transform, and cosmic censorship in spherical symmetry.</li>
    <li>Topics in the logic notes include: the Goedel completeness and incompleteness theorems, Kleene's recursion theorem, Slaman's theorem on induction in weak subtheories of PA, forcing, the Turing degrees, the axiom of determinacy, the priority argument, V = L, Cohen's theorem, weakly compact cardinals, measurable cardinals and their canonical inner model, large cardinals beyond choice, supercompact cardinals and their weak extender models, and the Ultimate L.</li></ul>
    Any errors and sketchiness were surely my own doing, please don't hound my professors over it!</li>
  <li><b><a href="research/formalizations.pdf">Formalizations of analysis</a></b>. Bishop's constructive analysis, Brouwer's intutionistic program, and pointless topology. Written for Philosophy 149 (Fall 2018).</li>
  <li><b><a href="research/hiv_dynamics.pdf">Mathematical models linking within-host and between-host HIV dynamics</a></b> with Dr. Naveen Vaidya et al. A summary of work done in viral dynamics at the San Diego State REU (Summer 2018), to be cleaned up and turned into two papers to be submitted soon!</li>
  <li><b><a href="research/baire_ordinals.pdf">Baire classes and the Borel sigma-algebra</a></b>. An exposition of the existence of a Baire function for every countable ordinal on every Polish space. Written before I knew how to use TikZ or knew any logic, so very amateurish.</li>
   <li><b><a href="school/NES105A/cuneiformarithmetic.pptx">Cuneiform arithmetic</a></b> (PPT), a historical presentation for Near Eastern Studies 105A (Fall 2016), as well as <a href="school/NES105A/cuneiformarithmetic">presenter notes</a>.
</ul>

<h2 id="gaming">Hobbies</h2>
<p>Raiding in Final Fantasy XIV is a hobby of mine. I play Paladin for the team "WE ARE NOT OKAY" on Faerie (Aether/NA).</p>

<p>I play viola for the Virtual Video Game Orchestra. Previously I was at the Intermission Orchestra at Cal (where I was also an arranger), the Central Valley Youth Symphony Orchestra, and the San Joaquin County honors high school orchestra.</p>

<p>I also edit the Final Fantasy Wiki and do a lot of technical work for them (bots, FFXIV data mining, writing CSS) for them. If you're interested, check out the <a href="https://github.com/FFWiki">wiki Github</a> and my <a href="http://finalfantasy.wikia.com/wiki/Special:Contributions/Catuse167">site contributions</a>.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, I wrote articles at great length for the <em>Bruin Voice</em>, especially about education policy. You can read some of my work <a href="https://bruinvoice.net/staff/?writer=Aidan%20Backus">at their website</a>.

<p>I also was once a chair at the Mathematics Undergraduate Student Association of UC Berkeley. I managed a proof-writing seminar and Shadow a Math Major Day.</p>
