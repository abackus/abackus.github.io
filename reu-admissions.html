  <title>On REU acceptance | Aidan Backus</title>

<div id="sec">
    <p><a href="/~abackus/">more of my stuff</a></p>
    <p>It is well-known that Research Experience for Undergraduates programs are
    <q>harder to get into than graduate school</q>, but they are well-coveted, both
    because they are well-funded programs which are invaluable for graduate school
    admissions, and because they provide students with exposure to mathematics
    far outside the scope of the undergraduate programs.</p>
    <p>As a rising junior, I was admitted to 3 out of the 9 REU programs I applied
    to. Given that said REUs often admitted fewer than 1 in 50 applicants, and that
    they are usually meant for rising seniors, I figure I must have done something
    right.</p>
    <p>Fortunately I have been able to speak to the program director of the San
    Diego State University REU about what makes a good applicant. According to him,
    there are only four things prescribed on the NSF grant, though I'm not sure if
    this generalizes to REUs in general. Also notably missing from this list
    is whether the applicant fits the program and its research project. So, while
    the reader should take the following list with a grain of salt, I hope that
    it will be useful to young applicants nonetheless.</p>
    <dl>
        <dt>Inability to conduct research</dt>
        <dd>The applicant should not be able to conduct research at their home
        institution; in particular, it is probably a tiny liberal arts school without
        much research funding. Applying from UC Berkeley counted a strike against me.
        Would it be helpful to make the case that Berkeley and other very large
        public research institutions (such as UCLA) do not have room for undergraduate
        research</dd>
        <dt>Strong transcript</dt>
        <dd>The applicant should have good grades in advanced mathematics classes.</dd>
        <dt>Strong research statement</dt>
        <dd>The applicant should have a strong research statement which indicates
        both their ability to communicate and makes a case that they have a strong
        background in mathematics. Everyone who applies to an REU is <q>passionate</q>
        about mathematics, so passion counts for very little; more important is that
        the applicant is able to persuade the REU that they have studied sufficiently
        advanced classes that they will not wash out of the REU halfway through,
        and that they are comfortable with struggle. For example, I wrote the following
        passage on each of my applications:
        <blockquote>[F]or instance, as part of a project for my analysis class, I proved
            that for each uncountable Polish space P and each countable ordinal \alpha,
            there exists a function on P whose Baire rank is \alpha. This originated
            from a problem posed by my professor: How does one generalize the notion
            of a Baire rank from the integers to the ordinals? In order to solve this problem
            I needed to learn basic descriptive set theory and measure theory.
        </blockquote>
        In hindsight, it would have been wise to also mention why I even attemped
        this problem in the first place: I had just bombed the midterm and needed to
        redeem myself: this would have highlighted that I am comfortable recovering from
        major setbacks, as so often occur in academia.
        </dd>
        <dt>Strong letters of recommendation</dt>
        <dd>The most important part of the application: if the letters were <q>lukewarm</q>,
        the program director would just throw out the application without reading it.
        To ensure strong letters, it is often recommended to go to office hours frequently
        and to ask the recommender if they could write a <q>strong</q> letter, so
        that they could refuse if necessary. This is probably the most difficult part 
        of the application for a lower-division student at UC Berkeley or a similarly
        large school, because of how little they interact with faculty, and I am not
        sure it is worth one's time to apply as a freshman from Berkeley.</dd>
    </dl>
    <p>If anyone has any other tips, I'd be glad to hear them. Good luck!</p>
