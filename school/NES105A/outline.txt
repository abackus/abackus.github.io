1) Before my presentation, we're doing a challenge, put it on instagram, the #UrukChallenge
Don't write anything down, don't use your calculators or phones

2) So you can respect importance of arithmetic

4) Focus on Old Babylon, where most documents come from
Hypothesis: Centralization began shortly before Old Babylon (Sargonic Empire)
Necessary to have arithmetic to keep up with administrative work

5) Counterclockwise from top right: 1 unit of textile, 1 unit of oil, 1 unit of wheat,
" sheep, " rope, " rope, "metal, "garment. Discrete amounts of continuous quantities, shows sophistication
As early as 3300 BCE - also thought that this happened alongside development of writing (per Dr Tanaka)

6) Plimpton Base 60 tablet (of Pythagorean triples - 1000 years before Pythagoras) 4th from bottom:
23,52,12

7) By Old Babylon we start seeing lots of tables, e.g. multiplication tables
Same time as Hammurabi's expansion. Studied by scribes in school
Shows a lot of algorithmic, step-by-step computation, NOT proofs and theory like Greeks
"An emphasis on tradition" as Leslie said

8) In base 60 because lots of regular numbers (divide with 60 evenly)
In fact, how they divided was basically 1/r = 1/(x+y) = (1/x)(x/(x+y)) = (1/x)(1/(1+y/x))
y/x is hopefully easier to divide

Given 2,5 = 125: 5 is regular, so we multiply by the reciprocal 12 (12 * 5 = 60)
12 * 2 = 24, 24 + 1 = 25
Iterate until we get a regular number.
25 = 2,24 because 12*2, 24 = 28,48
Divide by 60^n
28/60^2 + 48/60^3 = .008 = 1/125
Multiply that to get your answer
What we would call homework problems: quadratic and exponential growth
l + w = 50, take (50/2)^2 = 625, subtract 600 to get 25. sqrt(25) = 5.
l = 25 + 5 = 30, w = 25 - 5 = 20
Quadratic used to measure plots of land, exponential growth used for accounting, interest
Had word problems about interest - shows economic sophistication

9) Mid 2000s - shows clearly defined exchange rates, only possible by multiplication and addition
Shortly before Babylon, early consolidation, shows bureaucratic process
Textile exports from Elam?
Another example: list Bill put of sacrificed goods

10) Astronomy was practical too: important to compute moon cycles for use in omens, predictions

Innovation was slow - emphasis on algorithms and computation, not new theorems (like Greeks)
For all their sqrt problems, "Babylonian Algorithm" of CS61a fame not discovered until Roman times
Most documents are either school practice problems, or administrative texts
Great tradition of bookkeeping
